personSearch gateway pass-through option
 
The personSearch gateway pass-through option is available in the PhilanPermuter service.
 
The personSearch gateway pass-through option is activated by adding an additional element value to the personSearch input data structure.
 
The PhilanPermuter service uses the set of triplet queries plus the additional gateway option information to build a gateway HTTP request. 
In turn, it calls the gateway API using the HTTP request and returns a gateway result set.

This service can be run as an endpoint service by using a curl command.

INPUT
	personSearch file in XML format that INCLUDES a gateway option element
	
OUTPUT
	Gateway result set

INTERACTION
	This service will be called with a POST. 
	On a POST, the content body is expected to be a personSearch form in XML. 
	The service will process the data and output a gateway result set.
	
	In stage-jvm009 environment, personSearch file as input 
		curl -d @fileName "http://127.0.0.1:8080/PhilanPermuter.txt"

	Other environment running curl, such as louie, personSearch file as input 
		curl -d @fileName "http://stage-jvm009.newsbank.com:8080/PhilanPermuter.txt"

REFERENCE
	gateway element 
		encoded example:
			<gateway>product%3DPHILAN%26api_key%3Dphil%26cust_auth%3Dncdeditphil%7Cncdeditphil%26cust_auth_type%3Duserpw%26type%3Dtriplet</gateway>
		decoded example:
			<gateway><![CDATA[product=PHILAN&api_key=phil&cust_auth=ncdeditphil|ncdeditphil&cust_auth_type=userpw&type=triplet]]></gateway>
		
		note: The maximum number of hits is provided by user, if no max hits number provided the default is 120.
			ex. &maxhits=120
			
	Scorelimit element
		The scorelimit element tells the RankEvidence service what the score cutoff will be. If the scorelimit is 3, 
		then all documents that have a RankEvidence score of 3 or greater will be returned. If no value, the RankEvidence 
		algorithm will process the best cutoff score for each particular result set.
		
		ex.
			<scorelimit>3</scorelimit>
		
	option element
		The option element allows the flexibility to choose a desired output. If the value is 'docref', the output will be the docrefs 
		of the result set instead of the full gateway result. If the value is 'norank', just the relevance ranked gateway request will
		be output without going through RankEvidence. If the value is 'evidencescore', the output is a full gateway request with a <personsearch> element 
		embedded which includes the docref, unq and score of each document without having gone through the cutoff. If the value is 'evidscore-cutoff', 
		the output is a full gateway request with a <personsearch> element embedded which includes the docref, unq and score of each document having gone 
		through the cutoff. If there is no option element or if the value is not 'docref' or 'norank', or 'evidencescore' the output will be a full gateway 
		result set having gone through RankEvidence.
		
		ex. 
			<option>docref</option>
			OR
			<option>norank</option>
			OR
			<option>evidencescore</option>
			OR
			<option>evidscore-cutoff</option>
