<LED>As Sarasota K-9 Search and Rescue team leader Patricia Abrams watched the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., unfold Dec. 14, she felt compelled to take action.</LED>
<MNT>'When we heard about the events that day, I think the whole nation was in shock,' Abrams said of the shootings, in which 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza killed 26 students, teachers and faculty, then killed himself as police arrived. He also killed his mother prior to the school assault.<p></p>
'We deal with violence a lot in what we do, and I really felt that I needed to do something to reach out to the children and to the teachers,' she said.<p></p>
Two days after the shootings, Abrams sent a letter to Sandy Hook officials on behalf of members of the local K-9 Search and Rescue organization, expressing sympathy and outlining what the group does -- respond to reports of people who are missing, and use rescue dogs to find them. With the letter, she sent copies of the first two children's books she has written in her 'Noah and the Search Dogs' series to be placed in the school's library.<p></p>
'Each book I have written teaches children the amazing courage the search dogs have,' Abrams wrote. 'Each search canine has a special 'true' story of what their life stood for.'<p></p>
With the books, which include 'The Story of Boo,' Abrams sent baseball cards featuring different K-9s from the team, bookmarks and more. Abrams began writing the books when she noticed violence increasing around the world.<p></p>
'I'm so into children, and our team's passion is to keep them safe and teach them how to self-rescue, so we don't ever have to search for them,' she said. 'I've been meeting with kids in schools, so Sandy Hook was very close to my heart.'<p></p>
For the past three years, the K-9 Search and Rescue Team has visited Englewood Elementary School. Principal Mark Grossenbacher said there is a nonfiction story in the school's third-grade reading books about search-and-rescue dogs, and when the students read the story each fall, the K-9 team comes to the school for a demonstration and question-and-answer session.<p></p>
This year, students heard stories about how the canines have made a difference in the community, and the met Sadie, one of the group's search dogs. Each child was given a copy of Sadie's baseball card.<p></p>
'It's a perfect match,' Grossenbacher said. 'The kids read about it, they discuss it and they're tested on the context of the story -- then they get to follow up with the real-life thing. Just having the officers here has been fantastic, and it's been very memorable.'<p></p>
Abrams has written several more books and plans to eventually publish them all. Her next is the story of Tracker, and deals with bullying. In the book, Tracker conquers the bully in a forest that's based on the Carlton Reserve in South County. The bully, 'Uncle Hammy,' is modeled after a wild boar Abrams said they actually encountered.<p></p>
'It's all positive and it's not scary,' she said. 'When I've been to the schools after they've read the books, the kids could recite to me all the different safety messages they found.'<p></p>
The Sandy Hook tragedy also inspired Abrams to write a book on gun safety. She has a list of different social pressures in schools, and will be working off it for future books.<p></p>
'I'm just wanting to give the children, along with parents, guardians, teachers and others, messages of hope,' Abrams said.<p></p>
Calls and emails to the Newtown school district and Sandy Hook Elementary officials seeking comment were not returned.<p></p>
